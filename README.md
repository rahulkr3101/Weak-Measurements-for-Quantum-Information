# Experimental Setup

Successfully characterizing quantum states is fundamental to quantum physics and is crucial to many applications real-world applications such as quantum computing. To determine a quantum state, one can perform a set of pre-defined measurements and then, using a reconstruction algorithm, infer the most likely state that could have produced those experimental results.
